//Regular expressions are used for pattern matching in strings.

//To set a pattern to match, create a regex variable with the pattern wrapped in single slashes.

let helloRegex = /hello/

//using the test method on a regex with a string returns true or false.

let testStr = "hello world!"
helloRegex.test(testStr) //returns True

//note that the regex phrase is case sensitive.
