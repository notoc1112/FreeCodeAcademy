//Objects Overview;

//(Food for thought) Objects can be conceptualized as counterparts to literal real-world objects, which all have their own unique properties.

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};

//Individual object properties can be accessed using dot notation on the object.

console.log(dog.name);//prints "Spot"

console.log(dog.numLegs); //prints 4

//a method is a function that is one of an object's properties. 

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs."}
};

dog.sayLegs();

//note how the method is called, similar to properties.
