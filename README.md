# FreeCodeCamp

This is a repository to hold all of Edward's notes from his progress through the FreeCodeCamp program.
These notes are for personal reference and may be prone to errors.
Anyone who happens upon these is welcome to offer critiques and clarifications in the likely event that some terminology is off.

# Background

Prior to my starting on FreeCodeCamp, I had spent some time studying Python through Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python."
While I haven't completed that volume, and do plan to revisit it, the basic concepts about coding gleaned from it certainly inform my understanding of additional concepts.
Expect to see references to python concepts and conventions as I progress (i.e. the comparison between JavaScript arrays and Python lists).
