Responsive Image Size:

  display: block; /*further study: difference between block and inline*/
  height: auto;
}

"Retina Display"
Defining an image in CSS as half of its height and width will optimize it for higher-resolution displays.

Responsive Typography

Use Viewport Units to set text size to be relative to the size of the device viewing it:

vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).
vmax: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).
